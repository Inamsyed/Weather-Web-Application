Created an engaging web application enabling users to access real-time weather data for any city, complete with temperature, wind speed, and humidity information. Leveraged HTML and CSS to craft an appealing user interface, while JavaScript was harnessed to seamlessly retrieve and display data sourced from a weather API.

I harnessed the OpenWeatherMap API (https://openweathermap.org/api) to dynamically fetch and parse real-time weather data for cities specified by users. This seamless interaction between user input and data extraction was facilitated through JavaScript's asynchronous functionality, ensuring non-blocking operations and optimal performance. Furthermore, CSS was skillfully utilized to enhance the User Interface (UI), applying principles of responsive design and aesthetics to create visually appealing buttons and imagery, contributing to a user experience.
